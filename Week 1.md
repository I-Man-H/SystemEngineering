# Workshop 1: Life-Cycle Engineering
Relevant lecture: Week 1: System life-cycle engineering

## Introduction
A system’s life-cycle describes the activities and processes involved in the design and
operation of a system from its conception (identification of the need for the system) to its
end-of-life. Systems engineers consider all aspects of a system’s life-cycle during
development to ensure that it:
* satisfies the customer needs
* complies with all relevant standards and regulations
* can be maintained, supported, and—if applicable—upgraded during utilisation
* does not cause significant political, social, environmental, or economic harm
* does not expose the client, user, or anyone who interacts with the system to unacceptably high risk

## Activity 1: System Classifications
Identify and classify as many systems as you can. Find at least one example that are not in
the lecture notes of the following types of systems: built, natural, physical, process,
conceptual, static, dynamic, open and closed. Discuss the importance of system
classifications.

## Activity 2: Function versus Form
Choose an example of an existing physical engineered system.
* Identify the system’s purpose and who would be the client?
* Identify the systems inputs and outputs.
* Identify the functions that are realised by the physical subsystems and components of the system considered. Try and keep things relatively simple – around 5-7 functions at most.
* Consider the system boundary.


Take the resulting functional decomposition of the system. See if you can find an alternative realisation of the function of the system in a different physical system.

## Activity 3: Acquisition, Utilisation and Disposal
Dissect and discuss the different phases during acquisition, utilisation and disposal of a
system. Analyse the acquisition and utilisation of a system of your choosing, and determine:
1. what the greatest life-cycle risks may be (e.g. operation, maintenance, support, disposal?).
2. How might your analysis of the system’s utilisation influence its acquisition?
3. How might your analysis of the system’s disposal influence its utilisation?

## Learning Outcomes
1. Identify different types of systems through key behaviours and functionality
2. Recognise the difference between function and form.
3. Identify and analyse the various phases in a system's life-cycle, and demonstrate an understanding of the importance of considering a system's lifecycle early during the design process.
