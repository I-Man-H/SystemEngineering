# Workshop 4: Group Project 

## Introduction 
This workshop concerns the process of getting started on a project.
The initial meeting of a design team usually occurs either during the tender process (when the design team is bidding for the contract to undertake the design) or later when the contract is issued.
In both cases there is a natural stage of discussing the project scope and brainstorming initial ideas for the design.
This is a natural stage but needs to be undertaken with care, since it occurs before the formal requirements analysis process and before any benchmarking and more formal problem scope processes are undertaken.
It is always a risk that ideas settled on in the initial stages become accepted without proper consideration.
To overcome this tendency, it is good practice to undertake some of this initial discussion in broader groups than the design team.
In this way, the design team comes together having had multiple design discussions with different groups and will start from a broader understanding of the design problem and be better placed to undertake the requirements analysis.  

The Design teams have been randomly assigned across each tutorial which means you probably have never worked with the people on your team before.
This is a deliberate part of the course â€“ you do not get to choose the people with whom you work on a design team.
You will still have your tutorial team to work with and discuss with, but for the project, you will need to work in the new group.  
You will find your Group Project Topics on the course web site.

## Activity 1: Mentoring groups within the tutorial




## Activity 2: A Systems Engineering perspective on the project 



## Activity 3: Contact your group and decide on a project


## Learning Outcomes 

Understand the nature of the initial scoping exercise undertaken by a project team when first considering a project.  

Understand different types of requirements, constraints, and assumptions encountered during systems design.
