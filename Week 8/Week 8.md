# Week 8: Stage Gates

# Introduction 

This workshop concerns planning out stage gates and setting up milestones for your group project.  By this point all teams should have decided on what their projects are.  If there is still any team up unsure of their project or missing members then please get in touch with your tutor.  

This is the last formal tutorial for the course that concerns your group project.  After this, you will be interacting informally with your peers.

In this tutorial we will discuss stage gates and the documentation that you can prepare for a stage gate review.  

# Activity 1: Stage gate discussion 

Form into your project groups.  Go over the progress in your project groups.  

  1. Has your project group decided on a project topic.
  2. Has any work been done yet?
  3. Consider the primary deliverables for the report
    * System Requirements Specification
    * Functional Analysis (FFBD)
    * Conceptual Design and Concept selection
    * System Design Specification (taught in week 8)
    * Design recommendation 
  4. What are the stage gates that would be appropriate for these deliverables?  Note that I have not asked for a full system design specification since this would entail unnecessary detailed design work that is unnecessary for the learning outcomes of this course.
    * You only have a short time so I recommend only 1 stage gate review.
    * Remember that the presentation itself can act as a stage gate, you will have time afterwards to revise based on recommendations received at the presentation.  

# Activity 2: Arranging stage gates

  1. Do you think that your group would benefit from arranging stage gate review.  If so how would you go about arranging this?
    * Generally it is best to keep any arrangements fairly small 2 or 3 groups may exchange documentation and provide stage gate reviews for each other.
    * Any individual student should not be burdened with more than 1 or 2 stage gate reviews for other groups.   Donâ€™t let yourself be imposed on.
    * The best idea is get peers from different projects to do stage gate reviews for you, otherwise you will tend to get other groups ideas recycled into your feedback.  Better to get an independent view. 
  2. Who else might you invite to a stage gate review.
    * Do you have external contacts that might be willing to review documentation for you.
    * Do you have friends in other courses who would spare a few hours to read your documentation and come to a stage gate?  

  3. What will you need to prepare for a stage gate.
    * What documentation should be prepared?
    * Should there be a meeting?  Who would be booking it?  Will it be in person, or on zoom?
    * Should there be a presentation?  Or should you just have a question and answer session?
    * How will you capture feedback?
    * When do you think it should be scheduled? 


# Activity 3: Exchange contact details

If you are going to be working with your mentoring group in the next few weeks then you will need to have a mechanism to contact them and arrange meetings.   

  * Exchange contact details.
  * Fix a time to get back to your mentors about arrangements.
  * Get in touch with your other group members to discuss.   


# Learning Outcomes 

  1. Understand planning for project stages.
  2. Understand responsibility for project activities.
